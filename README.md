# 1.Here is the 10 students CGPA [3.50, 3.52, 3.43, 3.63, 3.48, 3.32, 3.30, 3.60, 3.86, 3.75. Find out who achieved the 2nd highest score.

# Algorithm 
### 1.Initialize Variables:
- set two variables highest and secondHighest
## 2. Traverse Array
- use for loop to traverse each element
## 3. Update highest element
- use swap concept
## 4. Findout second element
- If the current CGPA is not greater than secondHighest, and not equals to highest then it's second higest
# 2. Sort the above scores from according to the order of highest CGPA 

# Algorithm
# use two for loop
 ## Outer Loop:
- Start an outer loop from index i = 0 to i < length of the array.
## Inner Loop:
- For each i, start an inner loop with index j = i + 1 to j < length of the array.
## Compare and Swap:
- the CGPA of index j is greater than the CGPA at index i, swap the elements using a temporary variable temp.
# 3. Take a CGPA as user input. Now from the given array find if your input CGPA is present using binary search algorithm 
# Algorithm 

## Sort the Array:
- sort the given CGPA array in ascending order to use binary search.
## Initialize Variables:
Set low = 0, high = length of array - 1, and flag = false to track whether the CGPA is found.
## Binary Search Tree algorithm for finding cgpa 

# 4.Generate random 10 integer numbers in an array and print out all the numbers from the array and also print the max and min number from the array.
# Algorithm
## Initialize the Array:
- Create an integer array of size 10 to hold the random integers.
## Generate Random Integers:
## Initialize Max and Min:
- Set the initial values of max and min to the first element of the array.
## Find Maximum and Minimum Values:
- Loop through the array to compare each elemnet with max and min value.

# 5.Write a program that will break down the amount and count notes for any given amount
# 6. Write a program that will give following output:   
## Use two loop for printing the pattern

# 7.Take input as height of 10 babies in cm. Now find out the 2 lowest height of babies. 
# Algorithm
## Take User Input:
- Initialize an array to put the heights of 10 babies.
- traverse a loop to read the heights from the user and store them in the array.
## Find Two Lowest Heights:
 - Use a nested loop to compare each height with every other height.
 - 
# 8.Count number of words, number of characters without spaces, number of vowels and consonant from the given string

# Algorithm
## Loop through each character of the string:
- Increment the word counter when a space is encountered.
- Increment the character counter for each non-space character.
- Check if the character is a vowel increment the vowel counter.
- If itâ€™s not a space and not a vowel, increment the consonant counter.
  
# 9. Find the number of occurrences of characters in a String
# Algorithm
