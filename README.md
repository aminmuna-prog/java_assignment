#### Java assignment documentation solution and output are attached [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AU7Mh84kV3OT-WRlhC1HPAu3S2ZsaELAQsHOA9CyOQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### 1.Here is the 10 students CGPA [3.50, 3.52, 3.43, 3.63, 3.48, 3.32, 3.30, 3.60, 3.86, 3.75. Find out who achieved the 2nd highest score.

### Algorithm 
#### 1. Initialize Variables:
- set two variables highest and secondHighest
#### 2. Traverse Array
- use for loop to traverse each element
### 3. Update highest element
- use swap concept
### 4. Findout second element
- If the current CGPA is not greater than secondHighest, and not equals to highest then it's second higest
## 2. Sort the above scores from according to the order of highest CGPA 

## Algorithm
### use two for loop
 ### Outer Loop:
- Start an outer loop from index i = 0 to i < length of the array.
### Inner Loop:
- For each i, start an inner loop with index j = i + 1 to j < length of the array.
### Compare and Swap:
- the CGPA of index j is greater than the CGPA at index i, swap the elements using a temporary variable temp.
## 3. Take a CGPA as user input. Now from the given array find if your input CGPA is present using binary search algorithm 
## Algorithm 

### Sort the Array:
- sort the given CGPA array in ascending order to use binary search.
### Initialize Variables:
Set low = 0, high = length of array - 1, and flag = false to track whether the CGPA is found.
### Binary Search Tree algorithm for finding cgpa 

## 4.Generate random 10 integer numbers in an array and print out all the numbers from the array and also print the max and min number from the array.
## Algorithm
### Initialize the Array:
- Create an integer array of size 10 to hold the random integers.
### Generate Random Integers:
### Initialize Max and Min:
- Set the initial values of max and min to the first element of the array.
### Find Maximum and Minimum Values:
- Loop through the array to compare each elemnet with max and min value.

## 5.Write a program that will break down the amount and count notes for any given amount
## 6. Write a program that will give following output:   
### Use two loop for printing the pattern

## 7.Take input as height of 10 babies in cm. Now find out the 2 lowest height of babies. 
## Algorithm
### Take User Input:
- Initialize an array to put the heights of 10 babies.
- traverse a loop to read the heights from the user and store them in the array.
### Find Two Lowest Heights:
 - Use a nested loop to compare each height with every other height.
 - 
## 8.Count number of words, number of characters without spaces, number of vowels and consonant from the given string

## Algorithm
### Loop through each character of the string:
- Increment the word counter when a space is encountered.
- Increment the character counter for each non-space character.
- Check if the character is a vowel increment the vowel counter.
- If itâ€™s not a space and not a vowel, increment the consonant counter.
  
## 9. Find the number of occurrences of characters in a String

## Algorithm
### Initialize Variables:
- Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
- Create a LinkedHashMap to store characters as keys and their corresponding counts as values.
- 
### Count Character Occurrences:
-Convert the string to a character array.
### Iterate through each character in the array:
-if the character is not a space, check if it is already in the map.
-if it is, increment its count; if not, add it to the map with an initial count of one.

## 10.Print the  numbers which are not duplicate from the given array
### use nested loop 
## 11. Remove Vowels from a String
### use loop and if else condition

## 12. A core i 7 laptop price is 85000 tk and a gaming mouse price is 2500 tk. If I buy the laptop and 1 piece mouse, what will be my total cost after giving 15% discount?

## ALgorithm
- Define Input Text
- Extract and Parse Numeric Values
- Assign Variables
- Calculate Total Price
